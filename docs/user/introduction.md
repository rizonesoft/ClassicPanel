# Introduction to ClassicPanel

## What is ClassicPanel?

**The power of direct control, refined.**

ClassicPanel is a comprehensive, fast, intuitive, and beautiful Control Panel replacement for Windows 10 and Windows 11. ClassicPanel brings back the familiar Windows Control Panel interface with modern enhancements, providing direct access to 100+ system settings and utilities, refined for speed, search, and seamless navigation.

## Why ClassicPanel?

With the introduction of Windows 8 and later, Microsoft replaced the traditional Control Panel with the modern Settings app. While the Settings app offers a modern interface, many users prefer the classic Control Panel's simplicity and direct access to system settings.
