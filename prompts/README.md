# AI Prompt Templates

This folder contains comprehensive prompt templates for AI-assisted development of ClassicPanel.

## Template Overview

These templates are designed for modern AI coding assistants (like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.) which handle comprehensive prompts effectively. Each template includes a **Quick Reference section at the top** for essential requirements.

- **[general-request-template.md](general-request-template.md)** - General request/fix template (includes quick reference)
- **[polish-template.md](polish-template.md)** - Polish & refinement template (includes quick reference)

**Template Design:**
- **Quick Reference Section** - Essential requirements at the top for quick scanning
- **Comprehensive Content** - Full context and detailed checklists below
- **AI-Optimized** - Structured for modern AI tools that handle large contexts well
- **Human-Friendly** - Also serves as documentation and checklists for developers

### Template Purposes

## Usage Guidelines

### For AI Coding Assistants

**Modern AI models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)** can easily handle these templates. They:
- Support 100k+ token contexts
- Understand structured markdown
- Follow detailed checklists well

**Best Practices:**
1. **Copy the entire template** - AI tools work best with full context (modern tools handle 100k+ tokens)
2. **Fill in the placeholders** - [Descriptions], [Task IDs], etc.
3. **Reference specific sections** - "Follow the Testing section..." or "Use the Quick Reference requirements"
4. **Quick Reference Section** - Each template has a TL;DR section at the top for essential requirements

### For Humans

You can also use these templates:
- As checklists during development
- For code review
- As documentation of process
- For training new developers

## Template Structure

Each template follows this structure:

1. **Quick Reference (TL;DR)** - Essential requirements at the top for quick scanning
2. **Developer Persona** - Context for AI tools
3. **Project Context** - ClassicPanel vision, tech stack, and features (including 100+ Windows Control Panel items)
4. **Task Description** - What needs to be done
5. **Implementation Steps** - Detailed checklists
6. **Testing** - Comprehensive testing requirements
7. **Documentation** - Required documentation updates
8. **Git Commit** - Commit message format

**Key Updates:**
- Templates now include reference to all classic Windows Control Panel items (Phase 9)
- Multi-framework architecture support (WinForms, WPF, C++)
- Updated project structure
- Links to multi-framework architecture documentation

## Template Length

- **feature-template.md**: ~250 lines (comprehensive)
- **general-request-template.md**: ~255 lines (comprehensive)
- **polish-template.md**: ~320 lines (comprehensive)

**Why comprehensive?**
- Ensures consistency across development
- Captures all requirements and best practices
- Provides complete context for AI tools (modern tools handle 100k+ tokens easily)
- Serves as documentation and checklists

**Quick Reference:**
- Each template includes a Quick Reference section at the top
- Essential requirements are visible immediately
- Full context available below for comprehensive guidance

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Always fill in placeholders** - Don't leave `[Description]` empty
2. **Reference TODO.md** - Link to specific Phase and Task IDs (includes 100+ Windows Control Panel items now)
3. **Quick Reference Section** - Located at the top of each template for essential requirements
4. **Follow checklists** - They ensure nothing is missed
5. **Update documentation** - This is mandatory, not optional
6. **Mark TODO items complete** - Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in TODO.md
7. **Consider multi-framework** - Reference multi-framework architecture docs for UI components

## Customization

Feel free to:
- Add project-specific requirements
- Modify checklists for your workflow
- Create shorter versions for simple tasks
- Add team-specific guidelines

## Feedback

These templates are designed to evolve. If you find:
- Missing requirements
- Unclear instructions
- Redundant sections
- Better organization ideas

Please update the templates and keep them in sync with project standards.
